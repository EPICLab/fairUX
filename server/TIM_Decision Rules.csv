DR1,"When task description includes additional information, it should allow exploration of optional features or insights, via expandable sections or tooltips.","Information Processing, Learning Style","""Violation: Task form hides advanced toggles entirely.
 Solution: Include 'Advanced Options' dropdown with tooltips."""
DR2,"When multiple methods exist, default to the most efficient and clearly label alternatives as optional for advanced use.","Information Processing, Motivations","""Violation: 'Choose Quick or Advanced Setup' without further context.
 Solution: 'Quick Setup (5 min, standard) | Advanced Setup (customizable)'"""
DR3,"Multi-step processes must show the current position and total steps, with optional step skipping if task order is flexible.","Computer Self-Efficacy, Information Processing","""Violation: User is forced through steps in order even if step 3 could be done first.
 Solution: Show steps with option to skip/flex order."""
DR4,"When multiple tasks are presented, their dependencies must be explicitly shown like visual connection lines, prerequisite flags, blocking indicators, Timeline connections etc","Information Processing, Learning Style","""Violation: All tasks shown equally without guidance.
 Solution: Highlight 'Start Here' path, with other paths accessible via toggles."""
DR5,The same concept must be referred to consistently using the same term throughout the interface,"Information Processing, Learning Style","""Violation: Same label means different things in different screens.
